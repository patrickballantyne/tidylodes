Title: tidylodes: A package for extracting, processing and 'spatialising' data from the US Census Bureau's LODES database
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Patrick Ballantyne <P.J.Ballantyne@liverpool.ac.uk> [aut, cre]
Description: This package enables users to extract datasets directly from the US Census Bureau's database of Longitudinal
    Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES). The database contains three different datasets - the first two
    Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC) and Residential Area Characteristics (RAC) contain estimates of total jobs and
    jobs in specific sectors (e.g. Retail Trade, Manufacturing). The third dataset, contains OD flows of jobs from 
    residential areas to workplace areas. This package is novel in that it not only cleans these datasets and improves
    the recording of census geographies within them, but also converts these datasets to spatial formats that enable 
    spatial manipulation/analysis to be carried out.
